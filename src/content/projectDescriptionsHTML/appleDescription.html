  From 2020 to 2023 I had the privilege of working with some very smart people
  over at Apple, helping them build the ‘Explore’ application.
</p>
<p>The Explore app is the default retail display application for iPhone.</p>
<p>
  You'll probably recognize it if you've been in an Apple Store within the past
  eight years.
</p>
<p>
  My job was to take the designs for the application, generated by Marcom, and
  translate them into SwiftUI elements and properties.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Technologies_used:</b> SwiftUI, XCode, Python, Node, JSON, Proxyman, AEM,
  Git
