<p>
  From 2020 to 2023 I had the privilege of working with some very smart people
  over at Apple, helping them build the ‘Explore’ application.
</p>
<p>The Explore app is the default retail display application for iPhone.</p>
<p>
  You'll probably recognize it as the application that manages the screensaver
  animation that plays on all devices in Apple Stores globally. It 'wakes up'
  upon any user interaction (including eye contact with the camera) and displays
  a default application offering device, feature, and pricing information.
</p>
<p>
  As a UI Editor, my job was to take the designs for the application, generated
  by Marcom, and translate them into SwiftUI elements and properties.
</p>
<p>
  To do this, I used an internal tool, similar to XCodes' Storyboard, to layout
  SwiftUI elements (HStacks, VStacks, etc.) and configure their properties to
  create pixel-perfect, highly robust, accessible, and dynamic widgets and
  components.
</p>
<p>
  These components were built to be dynamic and adapt to fit content in 33
  different languages, as well as the different content featured in each of the
  eight different in-store devices (there are ≈8 different iPhone models being
  sold in-store at any given time), which all ran slightly different
  experiences, accomodated by the flexibility of the component system.
</p>
<p>
  The functional requirements of the application required a complex content
  architecture, to facilitate the template-y nature of the components. As a UI
  Editor that worked closely with content managers, I was happy to help design /
  architect the JSON structures responsible for providing application content to
  devices, allowing for complex features / functionality, and satisfying complex
  business and application requirements.
</p>
<p>
  I also developed tools (Python scripts) to conduct operations within this
  repository, such as checking the file signature of image files, as well as
  safely and robustly comparing and modifying JSON structures and content,
  within a large-scale repository containing content in 33 different languages.
</p>
<p>
  Since this internal tool we were using was brand new, and largely
  experimental, a lot of the work involved working closely with Retail
  Engineering to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Troubleshoot complex issues at all levels of the macOS application stack,
    including application issues, network issues and issues with the iOS
    simulator.
  </li>
  <li>
    Design and suggest features needed to fulfill requirements from Marcom.
    Design UX processes and workflows, as well as their associated UI within the
    application.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify discrepencies between native macOS rendering systems (like those
    found in Sketch and Figma), and the rendering system found in the iOS
    Simulator, as well as the iOS devices themselves. Conducted frequent
    on-device testing to QA complex and subtle visual rendering differences.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Special care was given to Accessibility,and all components were ADA compliant,
  being configured with the following Accessibility features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Components would adapt to accomodate any text size specified by the user in
    the Settings of the device.
  </li>
  <li>
    Multiple levels of Voiceover (Labels and Hints) on both text and images.
  </li>
  <li>Motion controls in the form of Play / Pause buttons on looping video.</li>
  <li>and satisfying color contrast requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Advanced from UI Editor to UI Dev Lead by organizing projects, automating
  processes, troubleshooting application issues, and managing the work of of 2-5
  other UI Editors during projects with very firm deadlines dictated by Apple’s
  seasonal product release dates.
