  Hi, I'm Max Nelson :)

  <p>
    I am a Web Developer with eight
    years of experience developing
    high-traffic, highly-visible,
    websites and applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have experience developing
    maintainable frontend build systems,
    solving complex problems, and
    delivering quality solutions to
    fast-growing startups and large
    companies alike. Developing website
    applications, tools, features, and
    components, using many different
    languages, frameworks, and
    platforms, and integrating data from
    a variety of web services,
    databases, and content repositories.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having worked at multiple mid-stage
    startups, helping to build their Web
    Teams, and develop their Marketing
    websites using multiple different
    platforms, including Wordpress and
    AEM, I am in a unique position to
    offer insight into these
    technologies from a developer
    perspective, to companies that might
    be considering making a change to
    thier technology stack.
  </p>
  <p>
    I offer consultancy services for
    companies looking to improve their
    websites, or develop their
    organizational infrastructure to
    support their technology choices. If
    you're interested in having a chat
    about any of these things, feel free
    to
    <a href="/contact">Contact</a> me.
  </p>

    When I'm not working on developing
    web applications, I enjoy the
    folowing hobbies:
