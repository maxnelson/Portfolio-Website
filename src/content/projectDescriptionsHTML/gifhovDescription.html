  A web application for creating gifs that play music when you hover over them.
</p>
<p>
  This is a self-initiated project that I built in 2015 as a way of getting more
  familiar with server and database technologies like Python Flask and
  PostgreSQL. Although I ended up learning a good deal about a few of the
  built-in (browser-implemented) Web APIs like the Web Audio API and the File
  API, as well.

<p>
  Back in 2015, this took me a couple of months to build using Python Flask,
  PostreSQL, Javascript, HTML and CSS. I recently rebuilt it using Node Express,
  Firestore, and React, and it took me only a handful of hours.
