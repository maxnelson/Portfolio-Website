  A web application for creating gifs that play music when you hover over them.

<p>
  This is a self-initiated project that I built in 2015 as a way of getting more
  familiar with server and database technologies like Python Flask and
  PostgreSQL. I ended up learning a good deal about these technologies, as well
  as a few of the built-in browser APIs, like the Web Audio API and the File
  API.

  Back in 2015, it took me a couple of months to build this website using Python
  Flask, PostgresSQL, Javascript, HTML and CSS. I recently rebuilt it in a
  couple of hours using Node, Express, Firestore, and React.
