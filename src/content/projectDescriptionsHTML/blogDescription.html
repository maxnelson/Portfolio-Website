<p>Timeline is a web application for creating and sharing timelines.</p>
<p>
  This began as a fun, self-initiated, side-project for me back in 2017, and was
  something I’d spend my nights and weekends hacking on. During my recent stint
  of unemployment I’ve had plenty of time to focus my work on this project and
  the result is a very exciting web application which I believe holds a lot of
  potential.
</p>
<p>The current version of the application is live and viewable at:</p>

  ></a>

<p>
  I am the sole developer of this project, and am currently dedicated to adding
  new features on a weekly basis.
