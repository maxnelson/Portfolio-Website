  At Cloudera, I was hired as the #334th employee. I joined a 'web team' that
  consisted of myself and my boss, sitting underneath the Marketing department.
  When I left four years later the company was around â‰ˆ1800 employees, and the
  web team consisted of four developers total, whom I helped interview and hire.
</p>
<p>
  Given this rapid company growth, and the small size of the in-house Web
  Developer team, we were forced to wear a lot of different hats, and typical
  work included all of the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Working cross functionally with website stakeholders from all different
    departments, including Marketing, Engineering and Sales, to prioritize
    requests, evaluate tradeoffs, and make sound technology decisions toward
    implementing requested features and functionality.
  </li>

  <li>
    Developing a variety of page templates and components using HTML, CSS,
    Javascript, JSP and HTL (Sightly). Components including:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Marketing Page Sections</li>
    <li>Filter-able Grids with animation</li>
    <li>Navigation menus</li>
    <li>Dynamic forms with strict Frontend validation requirements</li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    In addition to the Frontend components themselves, I also built
    corresponding authorable components in the AEM CMS using Granite and Coral
    UI. These form widgets consumed author input values and made them accessible
    to the Frontend components via the templating language (JSP scriptlets,
    later updating to HTL [Sightly]).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Managed and maintained an AEM 5.6 instance (back when it was still Adobe CQ),
  later upgrading to 5.8, and later 6.0
</p>
<p>
  Used Java build tools (Maven) to maintain local AEM instance for frontend
  component development. Used Git, Gitflow, SourceTree and Jenkins to maintain
  version control, build and test individual AEM instances (dev, stage, prod,
  pub), as well as to deploy code along instances.
</p>
<p>
  Administered the publication of website content. Used tools like CRXDELite,
  VLT-RPC, Query Builder to manage, sync and replicate JCR content (user
  accounts, marketing copy, image assets) between AEM instances (dev, stage,
  prod, pub).

<p>
  Used Java build tools (Maven) to maintain local instance of AEM for frontend
  component development.
</p>
<p>
  Used CRXDE Lite and AEM CMS to manage, sync and replicate content (marketing
  copy, image assets) between AEM instances (dev, stage, prod, pub).
</p>
<p>
  Managed Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager implementation, devloping and
  publishing events, triggers, and reports for the Marketing department as well
  as all website stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
  During this time I also completed the the 'AEM Developer' and 'Advanced AEM
  Developer' week-long training course at Adobe.
