  My time at Rubrik was brief but action-packed, I came on at a time when the
  company was growing quickly, and during the year I spent there a lot of
  progress was made developing their online presence. The two most notable
  achievements being:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Migrated the rubrik.com website from one hosting provider / CDN (Cloudflare)
    to another (Akamai).
  </li>
  <li>
    Migrated the rubrik.com web platform / CMS from Wordpress to Adobe
    Experience Manage (AEM).
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Prior to both of these migrations, I was hired on as the companies only
  in-house Web Developer, situated underneath the Marketing department.
</p>
<p>
  This meant working closely with the agency that Rubrik used to develop and
  maintain their Marketing website. This agency called
  <a
    class="external_link"
    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.pixelmatters.com/work/rubrik-website-design"
    >Pixelmatters<i class="fas fa-external-link"></i></a
  >, is located in Portugal, which meant a lot of early morning calls:), however
  they are highly skilled, and were a pleasure to work with.
</p>
<p>
  Working with Pixelmatters, I developed Wordpress page templates and
  components, using PHP (Timber, Twig), HTML, CSS (BEM), and Javascript. I also
  made global style adjustments and fixed small functionality bugs in various
  website components.
</p>
<p>
  Midway into the year, we began the migration from Wordpress to AEM. For the
  AEM site, Rubrik employed another agency,
  <a
    class="external_link"
    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.pixelmatters.com/work/rubrik-website-design"
    >Qualified Digital<i class="fas fa-external-link"></i
  ></a>
  to build and deploy the site.
</p>
<p>
  As the only in-house Web Developer, I worked closely with Qualified Digital to
  translate the designs (generated by a tertiary agency), into functioning web
  components. Midway through this process we hired on an in-house back-end AEM
  developer, although he was situated offshore in India.
</p>
<p>
  During the migration I wore many hats, and assisted the Marketing department
  in a handful of projects, including the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Administered the Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager accounts,
    configuring events, publishing triggers, and generating reports for website
    stakeholders.
  </li>
  <li>
    Conducted weekly website performance tests, identifying and implementing
    strategies / processes for optimization.
  </li>
  <li>
    Used tools like the AEM CMS' Bulk Editor and VLT-RPC tools to import manage,
    sync and replicate content (marketing copy, image assets) across AEM
    instances (dev, stage, prod, pub).
  </li>
  <li>Used CRXDELite to troubleshoot content issues</li>
  <li>
    Assisted in managing a CDN migration, working with Cloudflare and later
    Akamai to implement proper DNS configurations on existing, as well as newly
    acquired web domains.
  </li>
  <li>
    Developed the frontend of many AEM components, using Javascript, HTML, CSS,
    HTL (Sightly), and Apache Sling to integrate with OSGI-registered Java
    servlet applications, and a JCR Jackrabbit Oak repository.
  </li>
  <li>
    Developed a variety of components, including everything from Page section
    components to dynamic web forms with strict frontend validation. For
    example, developed a Frontend integration with the Greenhouse API; used data
    to develop the careers listing, careers detail, and Job application form
    components.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  After the site launched successfully, I was sadly let go from the company, due
  to disagreements between myself and my manager. However, it was a great
  experience and I have fond memories of my time, co-workers, and experiences at
  Rubrik.
